# ScanReach.WebsiteMap

This is a repo for a website map of partners of ScanReach and representatives working for ScanReach. It shows the areas that the partners and representatives each have and is based on what query parameter is entered.

## How the map works

Curently the default parameter is representatives. To show the sales partners instead, remove <sub>representatives</sub> from the end of the query and enter <sub>salespartners</sub> instead.

Click once on the map to activate it.

Hovering over, or clicking an area will show a popup with the sales partners logo and link to website, and a marker at the lat long where the partner offices is located.
When showing the representatives part of the map, hovering over, or clicking an area will show a popup with the representatives image, name and the default sales email and phone number. Clicking the email will open the default email on your device and enter scanreachÂ´s default sales email into the to: area. Clicking the phone will give you an option on your device to call that number

A user can choose list instead, this is especially useful on screen sizes smaller then 768px. The list will show all partners or representatives and the area that is their responsibility.
